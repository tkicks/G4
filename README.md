# G4

## To-Do List


 * Add change camera x and y button and functionality
 * Come up with 3 different grammars
 * Fix rotation so it's cumulative (+b+b second branch should be drawn 45 degrees to first)
   * Currently would draw both branches at 45 degrees making a diagonal line instead of angled lines 
 * ~~Add in ability to draw leaves in drawTree method~~
 * ~~Make a myDrawFunction that draws in x-y plane and and can be rotated about y to draw more robust tree~~
 * Make leaf colors a pallete instead of random (increment a counter%numColors and choose color from list)
 * Find better angles for the copy-rotated parts of the tree.
 * ~~Un-comment exit(1) on invalid input so the program closes.~~
